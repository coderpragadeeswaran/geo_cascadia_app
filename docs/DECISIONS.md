# Decisions log

Owner decisions that refine or override CLAUDE.md. Newest at the bottom. **Read before any work.**

## 2026-09-25 — after P0 orientation (confirmed by owner)

### D1. Run timings and cost (Q1)
The owner does not have the original full-run logs. `stage_seconds`, `total_minutes`, `street_view_requests`,
`places_calls` and (Trichy/Tiruppur) `vlm_calls` in `export.json` / `dashboard.json` / `run_report.json` come from
**resumed** pipeline runs, so they are not real full-run values (e.g. the Ward 29 export says 3.3 min; model_card says 11.5 GPU min).

- **Ward 29 cost/time:** comes from `data/model_card.json` → `cost_time`, labelled **"from model_card"** in the UI.
- **Stage timings** (from `dashboard.json` / `meta.run`, all areas): shown only with a **"resumed run, not representative"**
  badge. No Gantt or cost waterfall that implies they are real. That chart renders **greyed out** with the badge.
- If the owner later supplies the original logs, this rule is replaced.

### D2. Number conflicts
- **Countable facts** (triangulated assets, local-vs-VLM use-router split, building/asset/queue counts, route counts, …)
  are **computed from `export.json` records** (`backend/app/derived.py`). They are never copied from `story[]` text,
  `meta.run` counters or other stored strings.
- Mismatches (field, stored value, computed value, source) are listed on the **Trust page** ("data consistency").
  Known at P0 (from `python tools/p0_setup.py`):
  - Ward 29: `buildings_use_local/vlm` stored 193/73 vs 163/58 from per-building routes (also in model_card `full_ward29_run`).
  - Ward 29: run_report/story "29 triangulated / 239 approximate" vs 20 / 248 with `method=triangulated`
    (29 = assets seen by 2+ cameras).
  - Trichy: run_report `use_route` tier3_vlm 44 vs 41 exported.
- **Accuracy / evaluation metrics** come **only** from `model_card.json`. Floors validation uses **n=36**
  (not the n=33 in per-building `validated` strings).

### D3. Performance
- The "≤ 60 MB" target (CLAUDE.md §11 P7) means **JS heap ≤ 60 MB idle**, not tab RAM.
- deck.gl / map `devicePixelRatio` capped at **1.5**.
- **Reduce-motion / 2D toggle** (no tilt, no 3D extrusion, no camera animations); also honours `prefers-reduced-motion`.

### D4. Offline data mode
- If Supabase is unreachable or paused, the backend serves **read-only** data from `data/areas/*/export.json`
  (+ `run_report.json`). Writes (review decisions, jobs) return a clear "offline data mode — read only" error.
- The UI shows an **"offline data mode"** badge whenever the backend reports this mode.

### D5. Floors on the Trust page
- The **production** floors method (Nova Lite, 2-image few-shot, route `tier3_vlm_fewshot`) is shown separately from the
  **rejected** 3-example variant and the other rejected variants in `model_card.floors.rejected_variants`.

### D6. Supabase
- PostGIS lives in the **`extensions`** schema, so connections set `search_path=public,extensions`.
- Connect via the **session pooler** (IPv4) URI, not the direct host.

### D7. Technical notes accepted at P0
- `review_queue` asset rows carry no asset id. They link to assets by (lat, lon rounded to 7 dp, `asset_cls` = `type`),
  which is 100% joinable on all three areas.
- Route value `tier3_vlm_fewshot` (floors) is valid in addition to the §4 route values.
- `missing_asset_records[]` shape: `{asset_no, lat, lon, street, why}`, shown as a map layer ("register record, nothing detected").
- Fonts: Inter, with Noto Sans Tamil as fallback (Tamil OCR text appears in the data).

### D8. Toolchain versions (P0)
- Vite **8** + `@vitejs/plugin-react` 6, React **18.3**, TypeScript **5.9**, zod **4**, Node 24, Python 3.12.
- The zod schemas in `web/src/types/*` are the single source for TS types: `strict` for `npm run check:data`, `loose` in the app.
- `tools/p0_setup.py` rebuilds every `run_report.json` and prints the inventory plus the D2 mismatch list.
